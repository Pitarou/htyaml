To run the unit tests, just go to the home directory and call:

    python -m unittest

And it will automatically look for modules called `test_*.py`.

You can pass in the name of the module or module path as another argument.

Further options:

  --failfast
  --buffer  capture stout and stderr, and include them in failure reports
  --catch   *ctrl-c* aborts after the current test has finished
            press *ctrl-c* again to raise `KeyboardInterrupt`
